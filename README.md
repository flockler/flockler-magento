Flockler Magento extension
==========================

Flockler plugin enables you to display all your social content, including what your fans say about you, as a social wall. Collate social content manually or set up rules to publish content automatically based on hashtags or usernames.

In addition to social content, you can create your own editorial content (blog posts, product news etc.). All the content created & curated on Flockler is stored to Magento and shown on your website just like any other Magento-powered content, therefore making it SEO-friendly.

Plugin automatically creates a layout optimised for mobile, tablet and desktop, but as the content is stored to Magento, there's an option to create a fully customised look & feel together with your technical team.
